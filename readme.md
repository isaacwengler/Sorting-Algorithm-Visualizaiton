Sorting algorithm visualization tool built in Python using Pygame

I made this project to better understand sorting algorithms and improve my skills in Python. This tool shows visualizations for bubble sort, insertion sort, quick sort, merge sort, and heap sort. You can change the array size, and with each algorithing the dislay tells you the time and space complexity. 

If using this tool, use the arrow keys to pick an algorithm and sorting speed; click new array to get a randomly generated array, and click sort!
